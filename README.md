## API
Call your site with GET parameters to change the WhiteboardID or the Username

`http://localhost:8080?room=MYID&name=MYNAME`

* room => All people with the same ID are drawing on the same board

## Things you may want to know
* Whiteboards are gone if you restart the Server, so keep that in mind (or save your whiteboard)
* This is just a sample layout to show the functions available
* You shoud be able to customize without ever toutching the whiteboard.js (take a look at index.html & main.js)
* I'm planning to add realtime audio broadcasting feature in this app
